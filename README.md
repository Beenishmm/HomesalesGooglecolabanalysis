# HomesalesGooglecolabanalysis
Module 22 challenge 
INTRODUCTION
In this challenge, we were asked to use our knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then we used Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table had been uncached.


Here is an overview of the files and resources involved:

ReadMe.md: This Markdown file provides essential information about the repository and outlines the details of the challenge.

home_sales folder: This directory contains all the necessary files and data related to the home sales challenge.

images folder: Here, you'll find the images that are used in the README file to visually represent various aspects of the challenge.

Home_Sales_colab_complete.ipynb: This is the finalized Google Colab notebook file, where we executed the SparkSQL operations and recorded the results of the home sales data analysis.
